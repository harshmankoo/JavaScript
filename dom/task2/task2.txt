The Quiz App 

• Data: Create an array of questions:
JavaScript
const questions = [
    { text: "What is 2+2?", answer: "4", options: ["2", "4", "5", "6"] },
    { text: "Capital of India?", answer: "Delhi", options: ["Mumbai", "Delhi", "Goa", "Pune"] }
];

• Logic:

-Create a variable currentQuestionIndex = 0.
-Create a function loadQuestion() that updates the h3 text and the 4 buttons.
-When a button is clicked, check if the text matches the answer.
-If Correct: Increase Score, Alert "Correct!", and move to the next index.
-If Wrong: Alert "Wrong!".

• Data: Create an empty array cart = [].


• Logic:

Create a function addToCart(name, price).
Push an object { name: name, price: price } into the cart array.
Render: Loop through the cart array, create <li> tags for each item, and append them to cart-list.
Calculate: Use a loop to calculate the total price and update the #total-price span.


13. The Tabbed Interface (Class Manipulation)
• Goal: Switch between 3 views without reloading the page.
• Logic:
1. Select all tab-btn buttons and all content-box divs.
2. Add a click listener to the buttons.
3. When clicked:
Step 1: Hide ALL content boxes (add .hidden class).
Step 2: Remove "active" class from ALL buttons.
Step 3: Show ONLY the box that matches the button's data-target (remove .hidden).
Step 4: Add "active" class to the clicked button.

14. The Task Filter (Array Filtering)
• Data: let tasks = [{ text: "Learn JS", completed: false }];
• Logic:
1. Add: New tasks are pushed to the array with completed: false.
2. Toggle: Clicking a task toggles its completed status (true/false) and adds a CSS line-through style.

Filter:
"Show Active" button: Uses tasks.filter(t => !t.completed) and re-renders the list.
"Show Completed" button: Uses tasks.filter(t => t.completed).
"Show All": Renders the whole array.



15. The Live Form Validator (Events & Disabled Button)
• Goal: The "Sign Up" button should stay Disabled (greyed out) until the form is valid.
• Logic:

Add input event listeners to all 3 boxes.
Username Check: If length < 5, show #user-error.
Password Check: If length < 8, show #pass-error.
Match Check: If pass value !== confirm-pass value, show #match-error.
Master Check: If ALL 3 are valid, set submitBtn.disabled = false. Otherwise, keep it true.
